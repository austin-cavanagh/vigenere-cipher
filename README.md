<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Welcome to my Vigenere Cipher application. This application was created to help users encrypt and decrypt texts using the Vigenere Cipher method. It's great for those looking to learn about classical encryption techniques or to secure their messages in a more traditional way.

### Highlights:

- **Encrypt Text**: Users can input a plaintext string along with a key string to produce encrypted text using the Vigenere Cipher method.
- **Decrypt Text**: The application also allows for decryption of text strings if the user has the correct key used for encryption.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface allows the user to easily perform encryption and decryption tasks.

I hope this application helps you better understand Vigenere Ciphers!
